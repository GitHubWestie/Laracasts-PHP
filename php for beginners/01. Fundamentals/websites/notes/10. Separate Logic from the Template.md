# Separate Logic From  the Template

Templates may contain logic but it should be 'dumb' logic. In other words simple things like a loop or simple conditionals. It should not contain complex logic or communicate with external API's etc.

## Separate PHP Logic
Doesnt have to be every grain of PHP, just the bulk of it. Simple things like loops and conditionals in the *'view'* or *'template'* are fine.

The PHP logic should still be the entry point for the server so should still be called `index.php`. The view would then be `require`d or `include`d in the PHP.

```php
<?php

// All of the php logic etc.

require("index.view.php");
```

The syntax for `require` can also be written without parantheses.
