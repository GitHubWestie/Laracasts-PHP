# Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are designed for flexibility. 

They are basically anonymous functions.
They can also be passed around and used by other functions or assigned to variables.

```php
$filterByAuthor = function (array $books, string $author) {
            $filteredBooks = [];

            foreach($books as $book) {
                if($book["author"] === $author) {
                    $filteredBooks[] = $book;
                }
            }

            return $filteredBooks;
        };
```

But the whole point is flexibility and the above is still quite rigid. It can be made more modular.

```php
    function filter($items, $key, $value) {
        $filteredItems = [];

        foreach($items as $item) {
            if($item[$key] === $value) {
                $filteredItems[] = $item;
            }
        }

        return $filteredItems;
    };

    $filteredItems = filter($books, "author", "Phillip K. Dick");
```

This can be made ven more flexible by moving the logic to a function in the signature.

```php
    function filter($items, $fn) {
        $filteredItems = [];

        foreach($items as $item) {
            if($fn($item)) {
                $filteredItems[] = $item;
            }
        }

        return $filteredItems;
    };

    $filteredItems = filter($books, function($book) {
        return $book['releaseYear'] >= "Phillip K. Dick";
    });
```

This example works very simlarly to php's own array_filter() function
