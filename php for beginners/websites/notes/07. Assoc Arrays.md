# Associative Arrays

Assoc arrays are similar to objects. They can contain many data types and even other arrays.

A normal array is 0 indexed, meaning that each item in an array is assigned a number starting from 0. You would access this type of array item like this:

```php
<?= $array[0] ?>
```
*This would return the first item in the array*

In an assoc array the 0 index system is replaced by a key that is explicitly set.

```php
<?php
    $array = [
        "key1" => "value1",
        "key2" => "value2",
        "key3" => "value3",
    ];
?>

<span><?= $array["key1"] ?></span>
```
*This would return the first item in the array - value1*
