# Arrays

Array Syntax
```php
<?php 
        $books = [
            "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?",
            "The Langoliers",
            "Hail Mary",
        ];
    ?>
```

HTML elements can also be echoed with php. 

```php
    <ul>
        <?php
            foreach($books as $book) {
                echo("<li>$book</li>");
            }
        ?>
    </ul>
```

Sometimes php will get upset with variables next to other things like a TM mark for example. In these instances a variable can be wrapped in curly braces to be explicit about where the variable ends.

```php
echo("Some{$variable}text");
```

## Shorthand Loops
Mixng php loops and html can get messy so there is a shorthand version.

```php
    <ul>
        <?php
            foreach($books as $book) : ?>
                <li><?= $book ?></li>
            <?php endforeach; ?>
    </ul>
```

This can also be used with other conditionals.
