# Tools of the Trade

Recommends using HomeBrew and Laragon for installing PHP and mysql. Doesnt really work on codespaces though.

In the terminal:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

When this finishes it provides a couple of extra commands to run at the end. Once this is finished run:

`brew search php`

which should find a list of available php installs. Choose one from the list and then run:

`brew install php`

Append a version to that if necessary.

Finally run 

`brew install mysql`

and grab something like table plus for viewing database stuff. Or get comfy with the database command line ðŸ˜±
